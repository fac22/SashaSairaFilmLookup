# Film Lookup

## Project description
This site should allow you to search for a film via MovieDB, presenting the user with a few clickable thumbnails matching their search, and on clicking one it should display the guardian review of that film. Peter Bradshaw, the Guardian's chief film critic, has a reputation for being deliberately contrarian and often wrong about movies, this site hopefully will prove or disprove this hypothesis.

## User stories
 - A user should be able to search for a movie and see a list of thumbnails made up of the results.
 - A user should be able to click on these thumbnails, and see a list of guardian articles about the film in question
